# Covid-19-Test
In this project I used a ResNet-18 model and train it on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. 
This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19. 
Our objective in this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with reasonably high accuracy.
